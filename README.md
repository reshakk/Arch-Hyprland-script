# Arch Hyprland Install
I use this script to automatically install packages and in the future customize the whole system. 

**[This script is based on the JaKooLit script](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Arch-Hyprland)** 

### Roadmap:
- [ ] Finalize output commands
- [ ] Add more variability for package choices
- [ ] Add migration of all Dotsfiles and configs
